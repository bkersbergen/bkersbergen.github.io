#abstract: Recommender systems are ubiquitous in the modern internet, where they help users find items they might like. We discuss the design of a #large-scale recommender system handling billions of interactions on a European e-commerce platform. We present two studies on enhancing the #predictive performance of this system with both algorithmic and systems-related approaches. First, we evaluate neural network-based approaches on #proprietary data from our e-commerce platform, and confirm recent results outlining that the benefits of these methods with respect to predictive #performance are limited, while they exhibit severe scalability bottlenecks. Next, we investigate the impact of a reduction of the response latency #of our serving system, and conduct an A/B test on the live platform with more than 19 million user sessions, which confirms that the latency #reduction of the recommender system correlates with a significant increase in business-relevant metrics. We discuss the implications of our #findings with respect to real world recommendation systems and future research on scalable session-based recommendation.
