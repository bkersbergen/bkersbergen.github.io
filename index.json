Given a sequence of interactions of a visitor with a selection of items, we want to recommend the next item(s) of interest to interact with. Unfortunately, SBR models are difficult to deploy in practice, as (i) session-based recommendations cannot be precomputed offline, but must be inferred online for ongoing user sessions with low latency, and (ii) there is a huge variety of SBR models available, whose inference performance and deployment cost is unclear. As a result, data scientists must typically prototype and evaluate different deployment options in collaboration with devops teams - a tedious and costly process, which does not scale to multiple use cases. Therefore, we present ETUDE, an end-to-end benchmarking framework, which enables data scientists to automatically evaluate the inference performance of SBR models under different deployment options. They can declaratively specify workload statistics, hardware options, as well as latency and throughput constraints. Based on these, ETUDE automatically deploys and runs an inference benchmark in Kubernetes with a synthetically generated click workload, and provides measurements on the achieved throughput and latency, as a basis for feasible and cost-efficient deployment options. We detail the design of ETUDE and present an experimental study for ten different SBR models in challenging settings resembling real-world workloads encountered at the large European e-Commerce platform bol.com. We determine performant and cost-efficient deployment options in terms of models and cloud instance types for a variety of online shopping use cases. Moreover, we identify severe performance bottlenecks in the open source TorchServe inference server from the PyTorch ecosystem and in the implementation of four SBR models from the open source RecBole library. We make the source code of our framework and experimental results publicly available.","tags":null,"title":"ETUDE - Evaluating the Inference Latency of Session-Based Models at Scale","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1714129200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1714129200,"objectID":"ca7e386a895e492eb475f9934cdc3930","permalink":"https://bkersbergen.github.io/talk/guest-lecture-for-the-masters-students-econometrics-at-university-of-amsterdam/","publishdate":"2024-04-12T11:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/guest-lecture-for-the-masters-students-econometrics-at-university-of-amsterdam/","section":"event","summary":"A guest lecture on often-bought-together product recommendations.","tags":["guest lecture"],"title":"Guest Lecture for the Masters students Econometrics at University of Amsterdam","type":"event"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1713783600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1713783600,"objectID":"f81f6e629940cba20a45b04110451734","permalink":"https://bkersbergen.github.io/talk/guest-lecture-for-the-masters-students-cs-ai-and-ds-in-the-big-data-course-at-university-of-amsterdam/","publishdate":"2024-03-21T11:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/guest-lecture-for-the-masters-students-cs-ai-and-ds-in-the-big-data-course-at-university-of-amsterdam/","section":"event","summary":"In this guest lecture we will share insights in category prediction recommendations.","tags":["guest lecture"],"title":"Guest Lecture for the Masters students CS, AI and DS in the Big Data course at University of Amsterdam","type":"event"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1686787200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1686787200,"objectID":"9cb5fca3fe3ed8fe321bf9fe149060fb","permalink":"https://bkersbergen.github.io/project/cikm2023/","publishdate":"2023-06-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/cikm2023/","section":"project","summary":"Program Committee Industry Day","tags":["CIKM"],"title":"32nd ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM2023)","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1686355200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1686355200,"objectID":"d67e5b39780a7757ce0340c41ffcb34f","permalink":"https://bkersbergen.github.io/project/dsaa2023/","publishdate":"2023-06-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/dsaa2023/","section":"project","summary":"Research PC","tags":["DSAA"],"title":"2023 IEEE International Conference on Data Science and Advanced Analytics (DSAA2023)","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1682506800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1682506800,"objectID":"b555dd7be4df862aa5cea39819e90f83","permalink":"https://bkersbergen.github.io/talk/guest-lecture-for-the-masters-students-econometrics-at-university-of-amsterdam/","publishdate":"2023-03-21T11:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/guest-lecture-for-the-masters-students-econometrics-at-university-of-amsterdam/","section":"event","summary":"A guest lecture on self-supervised contrastive-learning for product recommendations.","tags":["guest lecture"],"title":"Guest Lecture for the Masters students Econometrics at University of Amsterdam","type":"event"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1668598200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1668598200,"objectID":"16f0a1d75ae78c860dc6991cdaaf2ef5","permalink":"https://bkersbergen.github.io/talk/poster-session-icai-day-ai-climate-change/","publishdate":"2022-10-09T18:30:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/poster-session-icai-day-ai-climate-change/","section":"event","summary":"What can you expect from this edition’s ICAI Day?

We discuss the design of a large-scale recommender system handling billions of interactions on a European e-commerce platform. We present two studies on enhancing the predictive performance of this system with both algorithmic and systems-related approaches. First, we evaluate neural network-based approaches on proprietary data from our e-commerce platform, and confirm recent results outlining that the benefits of these methods with respect to predictive performance are limited, while they exhibit severe scalability bottlenecks. Next, we investigate the impact of a reduction of the response latency of our serving system, and conduct an A/B test on the live platform with more than 19 million user sessions, which confirms that the latency reduction of the recommender system correlates with a significant increase in business-relevant metrics. We discuss the implications of our findings with respect to real world recommendation systems and future research on scalable session-based recommendation.","tags":null,"title":"Learnings from a Retail Recommendation System on Billions of Interactions at bol.com","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Barrie Kersbergen","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.
